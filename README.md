# Introduction

Hello and welcome to Jacob Matta's Course Project for Modern Applied Data Analysis at the University of Georgia. This document provides an outline for the creation of my project broken down by reproducibility steps and by project parts (parts1-6). Currently, I have only completed project parts 1-5 as shown below.

# Brief Summary
This study aims to conduct a secondary analysis of residents of the black community in Albany, GA that have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from September 2022 through February 2023 and live in the one of the three zip codes 31701, 31705 and 31707. The outcome of interest is the difference in vaccination rates by month from September through February. The predictor of interest is the presence of a COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Program Intervention. 

## Part 1: Outline of project
-   `Manuscript.qmd` File: Outline of this research project 

-   `supplement.qmd` File: Supplemental information and reproducibility information

## Part 2: Data Processing
-   `data` folder: Contains: Contains `raw_data` folder and `processed_data` folder

-   `code` folder:`processing_code` folder which contains the code for data processing 

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

-   `code` folder:`analysis_code` folder which contains the code for data analysis
-   `analysis_code` folder: contains code for the exploratory analysis which can be found in the `exploratoryanalysis.qmd` file


## Part 4: Statistical Analysis 
-   `code` folder:`analysis_code` folder which contains the code for data analysis 
-   `analysis_code` folder: contains code for the exploratory analysis which can be found in the `statisticalanalysis.qmd` file

# Repoduction steps 
1. Render each `.qmd` file in the `processing_code` folder 

2. Render the `exploratoryanalysis.qmd` file in the `analysis_code` folder 

3. Render the `statisticalanalysis.qmd` file in the `analysis_code` folder 

4. Render `Manuscript.qmd` file in the `products` folder

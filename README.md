# Introduction

Hello and welcome to Jacob Matta's Course Project for Modern Applied Data Analysis at the University of Georgia. This document provides an outline for the creation of my project broken down by reproducibility steps and by project parts (parts1-6). Currently, I have only completed project parts 1-2 as shown below.

# Reproduction steps

# Part 1: Overview, Background, and Introduction to the Data

# Part 2: Data Loading, Cleaning and Wrangling and a Bit of Exploration

Part 2 can be found in the processing_code.qmd file.

# Introduction

Hello and welcome to Jacob Matta's Course Project for Modern Applied Data Analysis at the University of Georgia. This document provides an outline for the creation of my project broken down by reproducibility steps and by project parts (parts1-6). Currently, I have only completed project parts 1-3 as shown below.

## Part 1: Outline of project
-   `Manuscript.qmd` File: Outline of this research project 

-   `supplement.qmd` File: Supplemental information and reproducibility information

## Part 2: Data Processing
-   `data` folder: Contains: Contains `raw_data` folder and `processed_data` folder

-   `code` folder:`processing_code` folder which contains the code for data processing 

## Part 3: Data 

-   `code` folder:`analysis_code` folder which contains the code for data analysis 
-  `results` folder: contains relevant figures that are the a result of the output from the `analysiscode1.qmd` code

# Repoduction steps 
1. Run each `.qmd` file in the `processing_code` folder 

2. Render the `analysiscode1.qmd` file in the `analysis_code` folder
